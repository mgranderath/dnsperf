# DNSPerf

This is a library that supports performance measurements for Do53 (DoUDP), DoTCP, DoT, DoH and DoQ. It is focused on 
providing a tool for getting performance measurements for single queries.

For now a simple example can be seen in the `main.go`

### Acknowledgement

The basis of this library was abstracted and modified from [Adguard's Dnsproxy tool](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy)
